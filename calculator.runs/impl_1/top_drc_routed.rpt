DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0 input basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0 input basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DSP sci_calc_inst/trig_calc3 input sci_calc_inst/trig_calc3/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0 output basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP basic_calc_inst/result0 output basic_calc_inst/result0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning

DSP basic_calc_inst/result0__0 output basic_calc_inst/result0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#4 Warning

DSP basic_calc_inst/result0__1 output basic_calc_inst/result0__1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#5 Warning
PREG Output pipelining

Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0 multiplier stage basic_calc_inst/decoder_out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net age_calc_inst/display_age/bcd_unit_inst/Unit_reg[3]_i_2__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin age_calc_inst/display_age/bcd_unit_inst/Unit_reg[3]_i_2__0/O, cell age_calc_inst/display_age/bcd_unit_inst/Unit_reg[3]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net basic_calc_inst/display_calc/bcd_unit_inst/Unit_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin basic_calc_inst/display_calc/bcd_unit_inst/Unit_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell basic_calc_inst/display_calc/bcd_unit_inst/Unit_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gen_rr/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gen_rr/refresh_counter[1]_i_2/O, cell gen_rr/refresh_counter[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT gen_rr/refresh_counter[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
logic_calc_inst/result_display/refresh_counter_reg[0]
logic_calc_inst/result_display/refresh_counter_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>
